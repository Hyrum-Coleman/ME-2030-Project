# Project Description
This project contains code that simulates the motion of a ball going down a ramp and around a loop de loop.
The code in the `Matlab Script` folder is the code for the first part of the project. The code in the `Python Script` folder contains the code for the seconhd part.

# Part 1

## Description

The first part of the project is to find the minimum height to drop a point mass from in order to make it go around a loop de loop with various coefficients of friction.

It utilizes bisection to quickly find the minimum height to drop the ball from with 16 decimal places of accuracy.

## Usage

To run the code, simply run the `DynODE.m` file in the `Matlab Script` folder.

# Part 2

## Description

The second part of the project is to find the minimum height to drop a ball from in order to make it go around a loop de loop with various coefficients of friction.

It doesn't utilize bisection, but instead uses some physics to find the minimum height to drop the ball from.

## Usage

To run the code, simply run the `main.py` file in the `Python Script` folder.
